## Dev environment tips

1. When modifying the WebUI, be sure to maintain componentization and clean code. Avoid duplicate code.
2. Do not add any report files such as xxx_SUMMARY.md.
3. After finishing, use `ruff format .` and `ruff check .` to format and check the code.
4. When committing, ensure to use conventional commits messages, such as `feat: add new agent for data analysis` or `fix: resolve bug in provider manager`.
5. Use English for all new comments.

## PR instructions
